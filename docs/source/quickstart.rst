Quick Start
============

The most reliable way to familiarize yourself with Transformer-PhysX package is through the Google Colab notebooks.
Several examples (built in and custom) are provided to allow users to quickly start running transformers to model physical systems!

Since the framework requires two phases, training the embedding and the transformer model, separate Colab notebooks are provided for each.
